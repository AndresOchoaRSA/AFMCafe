# AFMCafe [MFA approach in the presence of missing data]

Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) is useful to simultaneously analyze any data set variables which could be quantitative or qualitative. With MFA is possible to analyze complex data sets and provide many graphical results. In this repo, found files to reproduce the results of the manuscript "DATOS FALTANTES EN EL ANÁLISIS FACTORIAL MÚLTIPLE: APLICACIÓN EN DATOS SENSORIALES DE CAFÉ", you will find the data set and the script with all the procedures.

## Data 

Scrapped coffe quality dataset from [coffeeinstitute](https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/)

## Goal of this Multiple Factor Analysis

We idea is a proof of concept around of MFA behaviour in the presence of missing data. 

For this reason, When the data was scrapped, any fields are deleted up with the appropiate values automatically, according to percentaje four setting of NA's. Finally, we disccuss the behavior and summary our results with graphical analisys of coffe quality.

## Conclusion

As conclusion the MFA is an interesting and useful method, it makes it possible to analyze complex data sets, and because it provides many graphical results: we can visualize variables grouped, according to the observations. In this coffe quality application, we set a proof of concepts around the behavior of MFA algorithms with a quickly discussion.
